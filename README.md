A cloud-connected isolated and automated plant growth environment, able to generate any environment from a combination of independent environment parameters. 

Designed as both a hassle-free food production system and a research tool for precise and distributed mapping of the plant-environment relationship.

<!-- TODO: Build statuses? etc. -->

Submitted to the [NASA/CSA Deep Space Food Challenge](https://impact.canada.ca/en/challenges/deep-space-food-challenge). _Update_: PeaPod has won Phase 1 and moved on to prototyping for Phase 2!

## Background

See our [requirements document](https://github.com/PeaPodTechnologies/PeaPod/blob/staging/docs/design/requirements/Requirements.pdf).

### Features

See our [solution overview](https://github.com/PeaPodTechnologies/PeaPod/blob/staging/docs/design/solutionoverview/SolutionOverview.pdf).

<!-- ### Innovations
PeaPod is *not* a fancy container with a light stand. 

PeaPod can **precisely** replicate climates for optimal growing conditions, and also has the ability to collect plant growth data during the growing cycle. 
This data is then used to further *optimize climate parameters* so food grown in PeaPods will taste better over time.

PeaPod is *modular* and *easy to assemble*. 
Construction with aluminum extrusion allows PeaPods to be transported like IKEA furniture, useful for situations where a lot of food is required at the end of a long journey. 
A lot of PeaPods can be collapsed into a tiny space. 
This also means PeaPods can be configured to be any size to grow any type of plant.

PeaPod is self-optimizing, versatile, easy to assemble, and it makes food. -->
