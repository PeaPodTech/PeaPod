\input{../tex/Process.tex}

\section{Adherence to Constraints}

\subsection{Volume}
% 100chars

\textbf{Constraint}: \textit{Fits through 1.07m x 1.90m doorway; W < 1.820m, D < 2.438m, H < 2.591m; V<= 2m${}^3$}

\textbf{Standard Expanded PeaPod}: 4x3x1 units (0.5m on all sides) + control module = 2m wide x 1.7m tall x .5m deep = 1.5m${}^3$ (< 2)

With width treated as depth for the purposes of the considerations of the "room size" constraint, the Standard meets this constraint.

\subsection{Power}
% 1000chars

\textbf{Constraint}: \textit{Avg < 1500 W, Peak < 3000 W}

% For calculations and justification, see preliminary calculations Appendix \ref{app:power}.

\textbf{Total Power Consumption}: 1,284W

\subsection{Water Consumption}
% limit 1000 characters
% CNet = (Initial water input + water added over time + water used for cleaning – condensed/ transpired water provided back to crew)

\textbf{Unconstrained}

% For calculations and justification, see preliminary calculations Appendix \ref{app:water}.

\textit{Humidification}: CNet = \textbf{500mL initial + 50mL per hour}

\textit{Aeroponics}: CNet = \textbf{1.25L primed + 1.2L per hour}.

\subsection{Mass}
% limit 1000chars

% For part breakdown, calculations, and justification, see preliminary calculations Appendix \ref{app:mass}.

Total: \textbf{70kg}

\subsection{Data Connection}
% limit 1000 characters

% \textit{Automation}: All of PeaPod's operation is automated, save for a select few setup, maintenance, and harvest tasks. This is controlled by a central computer, which uses a "program" to enact the desired environment at each point in time throughout the plant life cycle. 
\textit{Remote Control}: The program may be changed \uline{instantaneously} as an \textbf{appended instruction set} with immediate effect.
% \textit{Feedback}: The feedback sensors provide the computer with information that will influence the control it exerts. For example, if the program indicates the leaf zone temperature should be set to 22 degrees C, the computer would apply greater power to the heater if the current temperature was 18 degrees C as opposed to 21 degrees C. This forms a control loop for each parameter, relying on one of many control functions (bang-bang, PID, etc.).

\textit{Data Presentation}: Plant and environment data can be viewed with \uline{live updates and video feed}.

\subsection{Crew Time}

\textbf{Constraint}: \textit{4 hrs/week}

For calculations and justification, see preliminary calculations Appendix.

Total setup process time (2 trays per unit, 12 units, 1 CM): \textbf{17.5 hours} (\textit{one person}) or \textbf{4.5 hours} (\textit{crew of 4})

Total maintenance time per week: \textbf{1-2 hours} (depending on program)

\subsection{Operational Constraints} 

\textbf{Constraint}: \textit{Terrestrial: gravity (9.81 m/s${}^2$), ambient atmospheric pressure (101,325 Pa), ambient atmospheric temperature (22 °C), ambient atmospheric humidity (50 \%RH)}

Design operates in terrestrial conditions.

Ambient pressure: tank, bladder, and nozzle are designed to produce indicated outputs at standard air pressure
Ambient temperature and humidity: less concern, housing is sealed and insulated
