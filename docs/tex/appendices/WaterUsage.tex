\textit{Humidification}: By using a mesh nebulizer to produce smaller and more consistent vapour, greater overall water consumption efficiency was achieved.

\textit{Aeroponics}: Aeroponics by design uses far less water than traditional farming. In addition, higher quality nozzles with adjustable directionality allow for more of the water to be sprayed directly at the root zone and with better and more consistent droplet sizes for better uptake. Finally, by enclosing the root zone in a watertight container, no water escapes, and runoff water collected at the bottom of the container can be recycled. 5mL/sec/nozzle @80PSI x 2 nozzles per unit x 12 units x 10 seconds misting per hour

In calculation, it is assumed that all aeroponic water is consumed, as all runoff water is recycled.
