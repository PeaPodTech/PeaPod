PeaPod provides astronauts the ability to select and grow produce of their choosing. Before takeoff, the representatives responsible for selecting and scheduling food resources for the duration of the trip must create a stockpile of seeds that will provide ample food for the astronauts throughout their journey. The variety, quality, and acceptability of crop selection is the primary variable for repeated consumption.

By maintaining optimal growth cycles, PeaPod ensures that the food produced is clean, varied, and fresh. However, program selection (especially those with chemical components, i.e. nutrient and pH solutions) also play a role, as these directly influence the composition of the food products.

The selection of proper crops and solutions, along with proper harvesting and processing techniques (i.e. only harvesting edible bodies, cooking for long enough) and harvesting timing (mitigated by notification), are the only concerns when it comes to product safety.
