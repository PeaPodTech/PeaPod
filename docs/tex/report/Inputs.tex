\textit{Infrastructural Inputs}: Reverse osmosis water (constant supply at positive pressure from onboard RODI system), nutrient solutions (stored, one container each plus refill tanks), pH solutions (one container pH up, one container pH down, plus refill tanks, stored), power (onboard power, standard 120V AC 60Hz), network connection (onboard network, for remote control, live video/data transmission), plant seeds (stored in vacuum-sealed seed bank, selected for variety and acceptability), input air (HEPA filtered, carbon dioxide-rich)

\textit{Process Inputs}: Plant species identifiers, environment program (for entire growth cycle, one per plant species), nutrient and pH-adjustment solution identifiers (compounds and molarities, i.e. solution A is 0.6M NaNO${}_3$)

Common nutrient solutions target specific ions, including bioavailable nonmetals (nitrates/nitrites, ammonia/ammonium, phosphates, sulphates), metals (potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron) and other trace elements.
