\textit{Products}: Edible plant matter, recorded environment data, plant metric data, live video feed, time-lapse capture

\textit{Byproducts}: Inedible plant matter (stems/roots/leaves/etc., waste), sensible heat (from thermoregulation pumping, managed by onboard heating/cooling), exhaust air (via HEPA filter, sterilized and dehumidified by onboard life support, oxygen-rich), minimal water vapour (as a result of higher air humidity, minimized by housing seal), latent heat (as a result of higher leaf zone temperature, minimized by insulation)
