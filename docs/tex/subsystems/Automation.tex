\subsection{Automation}
\label{sec:automation}

\textbf{Purpose}: Performing growth-, maintenance-, and data-related tasks autonomously on the basis of both schedule and necessity to reduce crew maintenance time, improve consistency of products, and eliminate safety risks. Maintains the homogeneity of the internal environment with increased accuracy and precision over crew interference, while enabling simultaneous control over all parameters.

\textbf{Function}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Inputs}: Environment sensor reading signals, program
    \item \textbf{Outputs}: Actuator control signals, crew messaging
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Method}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Setup}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Power is connected and system is booted;
        \item Program is inputted by user;
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Testing}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Power-on Self-Test (POST) passes;
        \item Systems enact program as intended;
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{Process}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Checks operating preconditions (self POST and per-subsystem);
        \item \textbf{Environment Control Loop} (matches \textit{Sense-Plan-Act} model of robotics):
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Receives and stores data about current environment state;
            \item Compares current state to desired state, develops a "plan" to reach desired state;
            \item Controls subsystem operations in order to enact the plan;
        \end{enumerate}
        \item Notifies user on maintenance requirement (i.e. non-automated input/output management, refills, repairs, etc.) and end-of-program (EOP);
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Shutdown} (either manual or EOP):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Stop subsystem operations;
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Features}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Computer System}: Manages \textbf{all} data collection, storage, analysis, and transmission/receiving, as well as planning and actuator control. Includes internal clock (for program, notification), network connection (for data transmission, notification), and storage (for data). 
    \item \textit{Camera \& Plant Metrics}: Top-down and side-view cameras. For live feed transmission to users (local and remote), as well as plant health and yield metric collection via \textbf{computer vision analysis}, generating $\vec P$ for the optimization routine (\ref{sec:optimization}). Metrics include:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Leaf health indicators (i.e. leaf tip burn, leaf curl, chlorosis);
        \item Leaf count, size distribution;
        \item Leaf density;
        \item Canopy dimensions/surface area;
        \item Plant height;
        \item Fruit/harvest body size, ripeness;
        \item etc.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textit{Environment Sensors}: Record the environment's current state. Covers each environment control loop (see \ref{sec:environment} \textbf{outputs}). Matches $\vec E$ from the optimization routine (\ref{sec:optimization}).
\newpage
    \item \textit{Diagnostic Systems}: Include informative sensors tracking system input availability, etc. as well as notification triggers.
    \item \textit{Program}: Set of action (e.g. lights on) and control target (e.g. hold air temperature at 22Â°C) \textbf{time-series} instructions;
    \item \textit{Actuator Control}: Induce a change. Covers each environment control (see \ref{sec:environment}, \ref{sec:lighting} \textbf{inputs});
\end{itemize}
