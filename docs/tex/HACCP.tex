\subsection{Food Production System Description}
% Incl. flowchart


\subsection{Critical Points}
%assembly: only approved parts that have been checked for leaks, contamination, materials, air-tightness

%seeds: vetted and tested breed from an approved supplier, not opened until moment of planting, food safety steps followed while doing so (hand washing, gloves, masks, hairnet...)

%growth medium: tested for bacteria/pests, handled carefully before installation

%system inputs: filtered air, clean water, properly sourced nutrients, all tested by appropriate standards

%maintenance: plants properly isolated when non-food safe materials are present---i.e. if LED boards need to be swapped, if something needs to be greased, if something needs to be glued

%harvesting: all food safety guidelines to be followed - hand washing, gloves, masks, washing, etc.

%re-planting: checking for no old growth medium, sanitizing growth tray with food-safe sanitizer

\subsubsection{Critical Point A}
\textbf{Hazard Description}
% aka hazard analysis, discover CCPs

\textbf{Critical Limits}
% What is the safe range AND the failure conditions for the CCP

\textbf{Monitoring Procedures}
% How do we know the state of the CCP

\textbf{Deviation Procedures}
% aka corrective actions
% How do we keep the CCP within range?

\textbf{Associated Documents}
% record-keeping and documentation procedures

% TODO: Verification Procedures?
