This is a PeaPod. It can simulate any environment in any location.

Aluminum extrusion and engineering plastic brackets provide a lightweight and sturdy frame while mylar-foam laminate provides thermal and luminescent isolation.

This form of construction makes assembly quick and easy while also maximizing space efficiency during stowage.

In addition, frames can be joined together allowing systems to conform to any size and shape desired.


Each PeaPod also includes at least one head unit in which the mechanical subsystems are located.

These subsystems are what allow PeaPods to simulate any environment.

Head units are installed on top of PeaPod frame units and are connected to water, electricity, and network inputs.



Lighting is provided by LED boards mounted on trays that are assembled similarly to the frame. These boards are daisy-chained together and connected to the head.


Similarly, growth platforms are assembled in the same way and consist of grow cups to hold the plants, in addition to a root area underneath.


PeaPods use aeroponics for increased efficiency and versatility.

RO filtered water first flows into the head unit where it is pressurized to 80psi by the pump and buffer tank.

The solenoid valve located after the tank allows the computer to control the operation.

When the solenoid is opened, the water flows through the injection manifold where it is mixed with nutrient and pH solutions before reaching the nozzles.

The injection manifolds operate as Venturi siphons and feature computer controlled valves to formulate a correct dosage.

The nozzles are located in the root area under each grow platform and theyâ€™re connected via quick connectors for easy removal. The nozzles only require occasional cleaning to prevent buildup from the mineral nutrients.


The head also contains the humidifier and dehumidifier.

Humidity is added by a mesh nebulizer in the head. This enables precise automated control and only requires cleaning occasionally. 

Humidity is removed via silica gel beads. Fans pass air through the beads and shutters allow for precise automated control.
Silica gel is efficient, non-toxic, and can be rejuvenated via baking in a normal oven. PeaPods make this easy by containing the beads in removable cartridges. 


Other simple maintenance requirements include, refilling the solution reservoirs and manual pollination when required. PeaPods will release an alert when any maintenance is required.


Harvesting is straightforward but varies based on the plant. PeaPods have the ability to grow any plant but may require different configurations respectively. When plants are ready for harvest, they can be stored in tupperware containers and refrigerated. 

Preparation method and time also varies between plants.

Like wise, seeds and buds can be collected and stored to be planted later, creating a sustainable crop cycle.



A major innovation that comes with the PeaPod is the optimization process. PeaPods collect data on each environment parameter, thus turning the plant into a function. This data is processed by AI models in the cloud to produce even better growing parameters.

Because of this, plants grown in PeaPods will be healthier, taste better, and yield more over time.



PeaPods provide unrivalled variety, versatility and reliability to food production systems for long duration missions.
